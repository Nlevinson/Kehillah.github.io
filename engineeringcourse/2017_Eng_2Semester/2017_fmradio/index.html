        Currently, we've completed our first build of our transmitter, however we are unable to receive the signal.<br>
        This is a problem, becasue it's extremely difficult to figure out where we went wrong.<br>
        Our solution for now is to rebuild the radio using a breadboard, which will give us more control in switching out parts and hopefully will help us find the issue. </p>

        We're almost done building our second iteration of the radio, using a breadboard this time. There are a few things we need to finish setting up. <br>
        Once we've finished it, we'll see if we can figure out how to pick up the signal. It's difficult because we don't know any way to figure out the frequency it's transmitting at except for trial and error. Hopefully we can find it this time. </p>
