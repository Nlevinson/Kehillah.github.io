        By <b>March-2nd</b> let's have at least one photoresistor give a continous reading of light level.
        If this is too simple, we do need to have 4 photoresistors connected, so you can proceed to this.
        But at minimum we need a photoresistor reading which is reliable and consistent.

        <p> We finished the breadboard radio, however we still could not receive a signal. We've ordered ceramic disk capacitors, which were included in the schematic we were basing our radio off of, and that may fix the problem. If that doesn't work, we'll try to measure the frequency it's broadcasting at using the osciloscope. </p>

        <p> There is a chance our radio is broadcasting successfully but the signal is too weak to be received or is on a frequency most receivers can't tune to. We can most likely solve these problems, but it's hard to figure out what the issue actually is. </p>

<font color="red">Let's make sure we are moving <b>beyond</b> the steering. We also have the motor, throttle, and drive-train to put in.
By <b>March-2nd</b> let's have some mechanism to steer. Even if it is TWO handles that the driver pull/push directly on the front-wheel
axel.
This will enable part of the team to move forward to work on the  motor, while others still try to get a better steering
solution.

          <td><h4>Concerns:</h4> Earlier, I had the servo rotate 360 degrees at once using servo.write(), and that was too much, so I was worried that one of the motors were broken as a result. I will learn to not do more than 180 for next time.

            We may have incorrectly assembled the radio, but it's very hard to tell what the problem is. It may take a long time to debug. We're considering starting over and using a breadboard, which will be easier to control.
